This is a toy CAS written in JavaScript.

Currently all it does is create parse trees.

Can play with it on the "homepage":http://jcorbin.github.com/jscas , let's just hope that I can remember to keep the gh-pages branch updated too.

For reference, the parsing approach is an adaptation of "Pratt parsing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Pratt except that I've rolled the token generation directly into the parser.
